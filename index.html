    <p>
        Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older
        centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full
        history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent
        operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
    </p>
    <p>

        Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many
        innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to
        collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version
        control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.

    <h1 class="thirdHeading">How Git works</h1>
    <p>Here is a basic overview of how Git works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)</li>
        <li>Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine </li>
        <li>Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes </li>
        <li>"Push" your changes to your main branch</li>
        <li>Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit</li>
        <li>"Pull" the changes to your local machine</li>
        <li>Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change</li>
        <li>Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)</li>
        <li>"Merge" your branch to the main branch </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 class="thirdHeading">Why Git?</h1>
    <p>Here is a basic overview of why we use Git:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Over 70% of developers use Git!</li>
        <li>Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Developers can see the full history of the project.</li>
        <li>Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.</li>

    </ol>
