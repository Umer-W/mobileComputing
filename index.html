    <h1 class="thirdHeading">Git basics</h1>
    <p>
        Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older
        centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full
        history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent
        operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
    </p>
    <p>

        Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many
        innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to
        collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version
        control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.

    <h1 class="thirdHeading">How Git works</h1>
    <p>Here is a basic overview of how Git works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)</li>
        <li>Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine </li>
        <li>Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes </li>
        <li>"Push" your changes to your main branch</li>
        <li>Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit</li>
        <li>"Pull" the changes to your local machine</li>
        <li>Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change</li>
        <li>Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)</li>
        <li>"Merge" your branch to the main branch </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 class="thirdHeading">Why Git?</h1>
    <p>Here is a basic overview of why we use Git:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Over 70% of developers use Git!</li>
        <li>Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Developers can see the full history of the project.</li>
        <li>Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.</li>

    </ol>

        Information About Different Commands
    </h1>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Init</h3>
    <p>The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to
        a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an
        initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.
        <br>
        By default, git init will initialize the Git configuration to the .git subdirectory path. The subdirectory path
        can be modified and customized if you would like it to live elsewhere. You can set the $GIT_DIR environment
        variable to a custom path and git init will initialize the Git configuration files there. Additionally you can
        pass the --separate-git-dir argument for the same result. A common use case for a separate .git subdirectory is
        to keep your system configuration "dotfiles" (.bashrc, .vimrc, etc.) in the home directory while keeping the
        .git folder elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Status</h3>
    <p>
        The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which
        changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git. Status output does not
        show you any information regarding the committed project history.

    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Add</h3>
    <p>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to
        include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository
        in any significant way
    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Commit</h3>
    <p>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be
        thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to
        the execution of git commit, The git add command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will
        be stored in a commit. These two commands git commit and git add are two of the most frequently used
    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Remote</h3>
    <p>The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections
        are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access
        to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.


    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Push</h3>
    <p>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you
        transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas
        fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches. Remote branches are
        configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken
        when pushing. These issues are discussed below.


    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Pull</h3>
    <p>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the
        local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common
        task in Git-based collaboration work flows. The git pull command is actually a combination of two other
        commands, git fetch followed by git merge. In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch
        scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at. Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge
        workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.


    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Branch</h3>
    <p>Use this command to view the information about branches in a repository.
        To delete a branch run command: git branch -d branchname
    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git CLone</h3>
    <p>git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new
        directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote
        machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository. This is sort of
        like SVN checkout, except the “working copy” is a full-fledged Git repository—it has its own history, manages
        its own files, and is a completely isolated environment from the original repository.

        As a convenience, cloning automatically creates a remote connection called "origin" pointing back to the
        original repository. This makes it very easy to interact with a central repository. This automatic connection is
        established by creating Git refs to the remote branch heads under refs/remotes/origin and by initializing
        remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables.

    </p>
    <h3 class="secondHeading">Git Check out</h3>
    <p>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the
        local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common
        task in Git-based collaboration work flows. The git pull command is actually a combination of two other
        commands, git fetch followed by git merge. In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch
        scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at. Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge
        workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.
